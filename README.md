The project aims to predict game results and assess player performance for a specific game. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that can provide insights into the outcome of a game and predict how well individual players will perform.

The project involves collecting relevant data, such as historical game data, player statistics, team information, and other relevant factors that can influence game outcomes. This data serves as the basis for training and building predictive models.

The models developed in this project will use various machine learning techniques, such as regression, classification, or neural networks, to analyze and extract patterns from the data. These models will consider factors like player performance metrics, team dynamics, match conditions, and historical trends to predict game results and assess player performance.

The project may involve feature engineering, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to refine and optimize the predictive models. Cross-validation techniques and performance metrics will be used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, the project aims to provide valuable insights for sports enthusiasts.

### Current Status
The current status of the project is scraping `FBREF` website and it allows retrieving all players from a specific team and examining their statistics. This functionality provides a solid foundation for further analysis and modeling.

By retrieving player data for the team, you have access to various statistics that can contribute to understanding player performance. These statistics may include individual player metrics such as goals scored, assists, tackles, passing accuracy, or any other relevant performance indicators.

Having the ability to examine player stats opens up opportunities for deeper analysis, such as identifying key players, assessing player strengths and weaknesses, understanding player contributions to team performance, and comparing player performance across different matches or seasons.

With this initial progress, you can now explore and analyze the collected player statistics, potentially leveraging statistical analysis techniques, visualization tools, or machine learning algorithms to gain insights and draw meaningful conclusions.

Next steps in the project could involve expanding the data collection to include additional teams, integrating match data to assess player performance in specific games, exploring correlations between player statistics and game outcomes, and building predictive models to forecast player performance or game results.

Continuing to refine the data collection process, improving the accuracy and completeness of the player statistics, and developing robust analytical methods will further enhance the project's capabilities in predicting game results and evaluating player performance.
